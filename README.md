Templates 
=========

This repo contains folders with a number of different templates useful for research projects, papers and presentations. 

It is a *work in progress* and will be periodically updated with additional templates as I get around to streamlining my workflow.

As I add new templates, I will provide a brief synopsis of each below.


beamer-pres
------------

- A template for LaTeX beamer presentations based heavily on [Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham's github repo](https://github.com/paulgp/beamer-tips)
- Figures should be kept in the *figures/* directory and the slideshow tex file is entitled *slides.tex*
- The template tex file is a clone of Paul's presentation on how to make better beamer presentations.
